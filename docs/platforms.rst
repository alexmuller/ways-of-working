Praekelt uses two main platforms for the bulk of engineering work:

1. Django

We use Django for websites, mobi sites, responsive sites, mobi HTML5 apps.

2. Vumi

We use our Vumi platform for SMS, USSD and other messaging protocols.

Use of any other platform must be approved by our engineering management, and may
need to be hosted separately from our usual environments, so please get this
sorted out prior to commencing development on a project.

Django
