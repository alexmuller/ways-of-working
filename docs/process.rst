Our project process
===================

The lifecycle of our projects is typically as follows:

1. We produce a Scope of Work for a project, which might not have all the
   technical details, but should be comprehensive enough to list all the
   features so that you can quote on the project's development. Wireframes
   may also be provided as part of the scope for your CE (Cost Estimate).
2. We work on a fixed cost basis for a fixed scope. If the scope changes,
   we ask you for a costing for the delta or new work.
3. The authorisation to proceed with work consists of a Purchase Order,
   without which you cannot invoice us - so never start work without the PO.
4. Development commences - see below. **If you don't have a github repo by this
   point, please bug us until we provide it - please do not use your own
   repo.**
5. We provide you with one QA server, with the same OS setup that we'll use
   in production - for all the projects you do for us, unless a project has
   special needs which justify its own QA server. **Please bug us for a
   QA URL for this project to be pointed to your QA server.** It must be on
   our domain for client UAT.
   Please note that QA may need sample or real data to be populated. Often,
   the QA data gets migrated to the production site when finally deploying
   that, so please ensure that dummy data can be cleaned up, and use
   **CMS credentials** on QA that are *suitable for production*.
6. You are responsible for deploying your code to this QA server, so that you
   can support the fixing of bugs found during our QA testing. You should
   **always** deploy to QA from the github repo, to avoid any side effects of
   uncommitted code.
7. We'll deploy to production so that we can support it - see below.

Our development process
=======================

The process involved in how we work is fairly straight forward and we
expect you to follow this as well.

1. We use `Git Flow`_'s convention with regard to branch names.
2. All work requires a ticket with a unique number or name.
3. Work happens in a `feature branch`_. Feature branches names are composed
   of the ticket / issue number along with a one-line description of the issue.
4. Write tests for the new features you are developing.
5. Make one change per commit, and follow `What's in a Good Commit?`_
6. Put the ticket number in the commit message. For github issues in particular,
   see `Closing issues via commit messages`_
7. Your schema changes are expected to be handled by a schema migration script.
8. When work in a feature branch is ready for review then we create a
   pull-request.
9. All collaborators on the GitHub repository are notified of the pull-request
   and will start the process of reviewing the changes.
10. Any issues, concerns or changes raised or recommended are expected to be
    attended to. Once done please notify the reviewers of the changes and
    ask for the changes to be re-reviewed.
11. Once all the changes are approved and one or more of the collaborators
    has left a `:+1:` in the pull-request's comments it can be merged into
    the main branch and is ready for a deploy.

For your code to be ready for review we have the following expectations:

1. It is to be pep8_ compliant and pyflakes_ is not raising any issues.
2. It is to have tests.
3. The tests have to pass.
4. There are no commented lines of code.
5. There is adequate amount of documentation.

Production Deployments
======================

Our DevOps team are responsible for all production deployments. This enables us
to support the live sites and systems after hours, and ensure that 
infrastructural requirements like backups and monitoring are standardised.

Please note that production deployments need to be booked with the DevOps team
by the appropriate Praekelt project manager, and that we deploy on Mondays
through Thursdays.
